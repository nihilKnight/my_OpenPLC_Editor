    List widget is a svg:group, list items are labeled elements
    in that group.

    To use a List, clone (svg:use) one of the items inside the widget that
    expects a List.

    Positions of items are relative to each other, and they must all be in the
    same place. In order to make editing easier it is therefore recommanded to
    make stacked clones of svg elements spread nearby the list.
